This is my digital playground where I am learning. I'm integrating and validating new technologies and ideas here, playing around with new UI / UX components and developing with the best coding standard I come up with.

At the same time I want to provide an audiobook player which is really easy in use and a joy to work with.
There are still some components outdated.

If you like to [contribute](#contrib) or [translate](#trans), that is very appreciated. But there might be impacting structural changes over time.

## Testing
It's always great to have testers to test new features. We use Google Play Beta Tests so everyone with a google account can join these here:
[**BETA**](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.ph1b.audiobook)
Please report issues like usual but tell that and which beta you are using ;-)

## Development

All help is very welcomed! We track all the issues and ideas in a separate [issue](https://github.com/Ph1b/MaterialAudiobookPlayer/issues). If you search for work to do, you can check the list of [approved features](https://github.com/Ph1b/MaterialAudiobookPlayer/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+approved%22). 
Its always a good idea to talk about what are going to do before you actually start it, so frustration can be avoided.

Some rules for coding:
* Use the code style the project uses
* For each feature, make a seperate branch, so it can be reviewed separately
* Use commits with a good description, so one can see, what you did

## <a name="trans">Translations</a>
The project page is on [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/material-audiobook-player/). There all the localizations are maintained. If you want to contribute, check if there are untranslated or wrong translated words. 

Or you can start translating a new language if you speak it ;-)
