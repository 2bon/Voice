# Why doesn't MAP support xyz Media Format?
Material Audiobook Player uses the media formats supported by the Android platform. 

You can see the currently supported file extensions [here](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/MaterialAudiobookPlayer/blob/develop/audiobook/src/main/java/de/ph1b/audiobook/misc/FileRecognition.kt). 
If a file does not show up even though it should its most likely damaged or not supported by your version of Android at all.

# Why isn't feature xyz in the app?
My first design principle is minimalism. So no setting / UI component that I don't think is absolutely necessary will reach the app.
